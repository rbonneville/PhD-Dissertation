    \caption[Mutational spectra per IDCS tumor sample.]{Mutational spectra per tumor sample. Each lego plot portrays the distribution of mutations in each sample, given their trinucleotide context. The X-axis of lego plots contains 96 possible mutation types that result when the six classes of base substitutions (e.g. C\textgreater{}T) are placed in the trinucleotide context of flanking 5' and 3' bases. The Y-axis represents the fraction of base substitutions in each sample within each trinucleotide context}

    \caption[Curated copy number variations per tumor sample.]{Curated copy number variations per tumor sample. Copy number variations (CNVs) were called with FALCON, and manually curated on a per-sample basis. The copy number of the major allele (red) and minor allele (blue) is depicted for each tumor sample. Areas without a listed allele are copy-neutral.}
